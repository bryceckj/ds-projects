    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "According the App Store data, I developed an app profile that was a combination of both **Reference** and **Social Networking** genres. \n",
    "- However, the Google Play data shows **Social** to be more significantly dominated by giant apps (which means it is more difficult to compete).\n",
    "- In addition, while **Reference** was popular in the App Store (top 3 avg), its equivalent **Books and Reference** in the Google Play Store does not fare nearly as well. \n",
    "- Due to these factors, it is possible that in the ***short-term***, the new app will fare *better in the App Store* market than the Google Play Store market.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "On the flip side, the fact that the app profile is a combination of both gives it a **unique value**. \n",
    "- It will not be just another purely **Social** app (for conversations, media, and keeping in contact), it has a ***targeted purpose*** based on reference material, and ***targeted audience*** based on the shared interest. \n",
    "- It will not be just another **Books and Reference** app (digitzed version of a book), it will provide a ***social edge*** through discussion with individuals who share the interest, it has ***reliability*** through user ratings on user summaries, and it provides an improved way to ***learn*** and refer to material.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "From a growth perspective:\n",
    "- The **Books and Reference** category is relatively untapped - it has great ***potential*** to grow as a genre. \n",
    "- Finally, since it is based on shared interest, *graph theory* and *homophily* suggest that ***network cascades*** and information ***diffusion*** are far more likely - which means that **growth** is more likely to happen, and happen at a faster pace.\n",
